# Project Overview  <a name="overview-main"></a>

### Context <a name="overview-context"></a>

A grocery retailer has run a campaign to promote their new "Delivery Club" - an initiative that costs a customer £100 per year for membership, but offers free grocery deliveries rather than the normal cost of £10 per delivery.

For the campaign promoting the club, customers were put randomly into three groups - the first group received a low quality, low cost mailer, the second group received a high quality, high cost mailer, and the third group were a control group, receiving no mailer at all.

The client knows that customers who were contacted, signed up for the Delivery Club at a far higher rate than the control group, but now want to understand if there is a significant difference in signup rate between the cheap mailer and the expensive mailer.  This will allow them to make more informed decisions in the future, with the overall aim of optimising campaign ROI.

<br>

### Actions <a name="overview-actions"></a>

For this test, as it is focused on comparing the *rates* of two groups - we applied the Chi-Square Test For Independence.  Full details of this test can be found in the dedicated section below.

**Note:** The Chi-Square Test For Independence has been used (as opposed to e.g. Z-test) because:

* The resulting test statistic for both tests will be the same
* The Chi-Square Test can be represented using 2x2 tables of data - meaning it can be easier to explain to stakeholders
* The Chi-Square Test can extend out to more than 2 groups - meaning the client can have one consistent approach to measuring signficance

From the *campaign_data* table in the client database, we isolated customers that received "Mailer 1" (low cost) and "Mailer 2" (high cost) for this campaign, and excluded customers who were in the control group.

We set out our hypotheses and Acceptance Criteria for the test, as follows:

**Null Hypothesis:** There is no relationship between mailer type and signup rate. They are independent.
**Alternate Hypothesis:** There is a relationship between mailer type and signup rate. They are not independent.
**Acceptance Criteria:** 0.05

As a requirement of the Chi-Square Test For Independence, we aggregated this data down to a 2x2 matrix for *signup_flag* by *mailer_type* and fed this into the algorithm (using the *scipy* library) to calculate the Chi-Square Statistic, p-value, Degrees of Freedom, and expected values.

### Concept Overview  <a name="concept-overview"></a>

**Chi-Square Statistic**
- Chi-Square Statistic is a measure of the difference between the observed and expected frequencies of the outcomes of a set of events or variables.
  
**P-value** 
- The p-value is a number, calculated from a statistical test, that describes how likely you are to have found a particular set of observations if the null hypothesis were true.
- P-values are used in hypothesis testing to help decide whether to reject the null hypothesis. The smaller the p-value, the more likely you are to reject the null hypothesis.
  
**Degrees of Freedom**
- Degrees of freedom are used to determine if a certain null hypothesis can be rejected based on the total number of variables and samples within the experiment. As with any statistic, the larger the sample size, the more reliable the results.
  
**Acceptance Criteria** 
- Before we collect any data or run any numbers - we specify an Acceptance Criteria.  This is a p-value threshold at which we'll decide to reject or support the null hypothesis.

So to summarise, in a Hypothesis Test, we test the Null Hypothesis using a p-value and then decide to reject/support the null based on the Acceptance Criteria.
- If p-value is *greater* than our Acceptance Criteria of 0.05, means the likelihood of being able to reject the null is less than our desired threshold (acceptance criteria), so we cannot reject the null hypothesis.
- If chi-square statistic is *lower* than our critical value (i.e. the chi-square statistic value of our acceptance criteria (chi2.ppf(1 - acceptance_criteria, dof)), we cannot reject the null hypothesis.

<br> 

### Results & Discussion <a name="overview-results"></a>

Based upon our observed values, we can give this all some context with the sign-up rate of each group.  We get:

* Mailer 1 (Low Cost): **32.8%** signup rate
* Mailer 2 (High Cost): **37.8%** signup rate

However, the Chi-Square Test gives us the following statistics:

* Chi-Square Statistic: **1.94**
* p-value: **0.16**

The Critical Value for our specified Acceptance Criteria of 0.05 is **3.84**

Based upon these statistics, we retain the null hypothesis, and conclude that there is no relationship between mailer type and signup rate.

In other words - while we saw that the higher cost Mailer 2 had a higher signup rate (37.8%) than the lower cost Mailer 1 (32.8%) it appears that this difference is not significant, at least at our Acceptance Criteria of 0.05.

# Data Overview & Preparation  <a name="data-overview"></a>

In the client database, we have a *campaign_data* table which shows us which customers received each type of "Delivery Club" mailer, which customers were in the control group, and which customers joined the club as a result.

For this task, we are looking to find evidence that the Delivery Club signup rate for customers that received "Mailer 1" (low cost) was different to those who received "Mailer 2" (high cost) and thus from the *campaign_data* table we will just extract customers in those two groups, and exclude customers who were in the control group.

In the code below, we:

* Load in the Python libraries we require for importing the data and performing the chi-square test (using scipy)
* Import the required data from the *campaign_data* table
* Exclude customers in the control group, giving us a dataset with Mailer 1 & Mailer 2 customers only

<br>

```python

# install the required python libraries
import pandas as pd  
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency, chi2

# import campaign data
campaign_data = ...

# remove customers who were in the control group
campaign_data = campaign_data.loc[campaign_data["mailer_type"] != "Control"]

```
<br>
A sample of this data (the first 10 rows) can be seen below:
<br>
<br>

| **customer_id** | **campaign_name** | **mailer_type** | **signup_flag** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 74 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 1 |
| 524 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 1 |
| 607 | delivery_club | Mailer2 | 1 |
| 343 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 0 |
| 322 | delivery_club | Mailer2 | 1 |
| 115 | delivery_club | Mailer2 | 0 |
| 1 | delivery_club | Mailer2 | 1 |
| 120 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 1 |
| 52 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 1 |
| 405 | delivery_club | Mailer1 | 0 |
| 435 | delivery_club | Mailer2 | 0 |

<br>
In the DataFrame we have:

* customer_id
* campaign name
* mailer_type (either Mailer1 or Mailer2)
* signup_flag (either 1 or 0)

# Applying Chi-Square Test For Independence <a name="chi-square-application"></a>

#### State Hypotheses & Acceptance Criteria For Test

```python

# specify hypotheses & acceptance criteria for test
null_hypothesis = "There is no relationship between mailer type and signup rate.  They are independent"
alternate_hypothesis = "There is a relationship between mailer type and signup rate.  They are not independent"
acceptance_criteria = 0.05

```

<br>

#### Calculate Observed Frequencies & Expected Frequencies

As mentioned in the section above, in a Chi-Square Test For Independence, the *observed frequencies* are the true values that we’ve seen, in other words the actual rates per group in the data itself.  The *expected frequencies* are what we would *expect* to see based on *all* of the data combined.

The below code:

* Summarises our dataset to a 2x2 matrix for *signup_flag* by *mailer_type*
* Based on this, calculates the:
    * Chi-Square Statistic
    * p-value
    * Degrees of Freedom
    * Expected Values
* Prints out the Chi-Square Statistic & p-value from the test
* Calculates the Critical Value based upon our Acceptance Criteria & the Degrees Of Freedom
* Prints out the Critical Value

```python

# aggregate our data to get observed values (The pandas crosstab function builds a cross-tabulation table that can show the frequency with which certain groups of data appear)
observed_values = pd.crosstab(campaign_data["mailer_type"], campaign_data["signup_flag"]).values

# run the chi-square test
chi2_statistic, p_value, dof, expected_values = chi2_contingency(observed_values, correction = False)

# print chi-square statistic
print(chi2_statistic)
>> 1.94

# print p-value
print(p_value)
>> 0.16

# find the critical value for our test
critical_value = chi2.ppf(1 - acceptance_criteria, dof)

# print critical value
print(critical_value)
>> 3.84

```
<br>
Based upon our observed values, we can give this all some context with the sign-up rate of each group.  We get:

* Mailer 1 (Low Cost): **32.8%** signup rate
* Mailer 2 (High Cost): **37.8%** signup rate

From this, we can see that the higher cost mailer does lead to a higher signup rate.  The results from our Chi-Square Test will provide us more information about how confident we can be that this difference is robust, or if it might have occured by chance.

We have a Chi-Square Statistic of **1.94** and a p-value of **0.16**.  The critical value for our specified Acceptance Criteria of 0.05 is **3.84**

**Note** When applying the Chi-Square Test above, we use the parameter *correction = False* which means we are applying what is known as the *Yate's Correction* which is applied when your Degrees of Freedom is equal to one. (i.e. subtracting 0.5 from the difference between each observed value and its expected value in a 2 × 2 contingency table.) This correction helps to prevent overestimation of statistical signficance in this case.

# Analysing The Results <a name="chi-square-results"></a>

At this point we have everything we need to understand the results of our Chi-Square test - and just from the results above we can see that, since our resulting p-value of **0.16** is *greater* than our Acceptance Criteria of 0.05 then we will _retain_ the Null Hypothesis and conclude that there is no significant difference between the signup rates of Mailer 1 and Mailer 2. 

We can make the same conclusion based upon our resulting Chi-Square statistic of **1.94** being _lower_ than our Critical Value of **3.84**

To make this script more dynamic, we can create code to automatically interpret the results and explain the outcome to us...

```python

# print the results (based upon p-value)
if p_value <= acceptance_criteria:
    print(f"As our p-value of {p_value} is lower than our acceptance_criteria of {acceptance_criteria} - we reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that: {alternate_hypothesis}")
else:
    print(f"As our p-value of {p_value} is higher than our acceptance_criteria of {acceptance_criteria} - we retain the null hypothesis, and conclude that: {null_hypothesis}")

>> As our p-value of 0.16351 is higher than our acceptance_criteria of 0.05 - we retain the null hypothesis, and conclude that: There is no relationship between mailer type and signup rate.  They are independent


# print the results (based upon p-value)
if chi2_statistic >= critical_value:
    print(f"As our chi-square statistic of {chi2_statistic} is higher than our critical value of {critical_value} - we reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that: {alternate_hypothesis}")
else:
    print(f"As our chi-square statistic of {chi2_statistic} is lower than our critical value of {critical_value} - we retain the null hypothesis, and conclude that: {null_hypothesis}")
    
>> As our chi-square statistic of 1.9414 is lower than our critical value of 3.841458820694124 - we retain the null hypothesis, and conclude that: There is no relationship between mailer type and signup rate.  They are independent

```
<br>
As we can see from the outputs of these print statements, we do indeed retain the null hypothesis.  We could not find enough evidence that the signup rates for Mailer 1 and Mailer 2 were different - and thus conclude that there was no significant difference.

___

<br>

# Discussion <a name="discussion"></a>

While we saw that the higher cost Mailer 2 had a higher signup rate (37.8%) than the lower cost Mailer 1 (32.8%) it appears that this difference is not significant, at least at our Acceptance Criteria of 0.05.

Without running this Hypothesis Test, the client may have concluded that they should always look to go with higher cost mailers - and from what we've seen in this test, that may not be a great decision.  It would result in them spending more, but not *necessarily* gaining any extra revenue as a result

Our results here also do not say that there *definitely isn't a difference between the two mailers* - we are only advising that we should not make any rigid conclusions *at this point*.  

Running more A/B Tests like this, gathering more data, and then re-running this test may provide us, and the client more insight.
